This project's goal is to erase red text written on a piece of newspaper from a prerecorded video.
In the video there is a pen that scans across the newspaper to indicate how much of the text should be erased in that frame.
This project utilizes the color masking to separate what portion of each of the video frames is a part of the newspaper, the pen, or the red text.
The program then utilizes the texture synthesis by non-parametric sampling algorithm to replace the red text with a pattern that matches the surrounding newspaper.

Below is a link to repository with the final code.
